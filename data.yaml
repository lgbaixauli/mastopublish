    quote: "In Reading [England] there is this thing called the IDR, short for \"Inner Distribution Road\", which is bureaucratese for \"Big thing that cost a lot of money and relieves traffic problems, provided all your traffic wants to orbit the town centre permanently\". It's a 2-3 lane dual carriageway that goes round the town centre. It has lots of roundabouts, an overhead section, a couple of spare motorway-like exits (that's British motorways -- y'know, the roundabout with the main road going under it), and a thing called the Watlington Street Gyratory, where you have to get in lane for your intended destination about three years and two corners before you get there *with no signposting*. I used to cycle along it every day to get to school, before I fell off at 35 mph. [Kids! Don't try this at home!]  I know it well. I believe it is impossible to leave Reading heading west."

He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir *instantaneously*. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed."
