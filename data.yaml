Or are you just another stupid toddler who thinks they're an adult simple because they've grown older and, unfortunately, have developed fully-functioning sexual organs?  Would you like some committee somewhere to decide *everything* for you?  Get a damn grip, will you?  And shut the wretched kid up !'"

    quote: "However, you do *need* rules.  Driving on the left (or the right or, in parts of Europe, on the left and the right as the mood takes you) is a rule which works, since following it means you're more likely to reach your intended rather than your final destination."
